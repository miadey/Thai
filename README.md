# Welcome to the Thai Stack!

This project uses an innovative blend of technologies known as the "Thai Stack", which includes Tailwind CSS, Htmx, Alpine.js, and the Internet Computer using Motoko for developping full stack apps on the blockchain.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that helps us build custom, responsive user interfaces quickly and efficiently.

- **Htmx**: A JavaScript library that lets us use modern browser features directly from HTML, without the need for additional JavaScript. This helps keep our front-end code clean and understandable.

- **Alpine.js**: A lightweight JavaScript framework similar to Vue or React, but much smaller and with no build step required. We use Alpine.js to add interactivity to our website.

- **Internet Computer using Motoko**: An innovative decentralized computing platform developed by Dfinity. We use it to build secure, open, and scalable software. Motoko is a language specifically designed for the Internet Computer, making our applications efficient and secure.

This unique tech stack allows us to create a secure, scalable backend, while also focusing on a clean, easy-to-use, and interactive frontend. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, we hope you find the Thai Stack approach as exciting as we do.

Please feel free to explore the code and contribute. Happy coding!
